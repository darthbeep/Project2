The entire reason this message exists is to deal with situations like this. Because there are so many errors, and coming up with new error messages is lazy. So this entire situation has risen from the fact that you are now too lazy to write your own error messages. Honestly, you should feel ashamed. Anyway, you're about one error message away from giving up and becoming a goat herder is Iceland. You should actually consider doing that. It would probably be a lot more fun than figuring out what's wrong."

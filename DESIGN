Speed dating simulator
By Shaina Peters and Matthew So
This project is a speed dating simulator. It will include a number of participants. The participants will first choose a unique username. Then they  will connect with random people for two minute sessions and talk to them through a chat room, with both members of the chat responding to random "prompts". After they have talked to everyone, they will enter the username of their favorite person to chat with, and if two people name each other, they will be informed and will go into a new chat to give each other their contact information.
When a new user logs on, they will meet a screen asking for a username. Assuming no one else in the group has taken that username yet, they will be logged on and wait until the group has enough people. Then they will put in a one on one chat room with another person for two minutes. There will be a prompt (such as "What do you want in someone") at the beginning of each conversation and each person will respond to it. After two minutes, the cycle will repeat until the user has talked with everyone. Then the user will be asked for the username of their favorite person to talk to. If they have a match, they will be put in a chat room with that person for up to 10 minutes, after which they will be logged off. Otherwise, they will be logged off immediately.

Started project - 1/14 - Shaina Peters
I built the start of the project, based on DW's networking code. So far, clients can send usernames to the server. While the server can record the number of clients that have sent their username (using shared memory), I have yet to develop an efficient way of storing the usernames. Originally, they were meant to be stored by an array person structs, but that code is being a little buggy.
The way usernames are transfered is (supposed to be) the client prompts and recieves a username. It then adds 00 to the front of the username and sends that to the server. The server detects that the message it has recieved starts with 00 and tries to see if the username has already been taken, by looking at the list of previous usernames. If the username is free, it tells the client it has a good username and the client is free to send messages (in this case, messages are just replied to with the message slightly altered). If the username is not good, the client is once again asked for a username.

Added file sharing functions for server and client.
